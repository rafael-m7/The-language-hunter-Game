# The-language-hunter-Game

The game is set in a world where humanity has been fragmented by the confusion of languages after Nimrod's attempt to build a tower that would reach the heavens. The narrative focus lies on the group “The Linguists,” who possess the knowledge of divine languages capable of shaping reality, facing the curse left by the tyrant before his death.
